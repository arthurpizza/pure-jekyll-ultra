												<p>Let’s talk about comments. Well, actually, you’re only going to <strong>read</strong> about comments because I’ve decided to remove the comment function from this site.</p>

<p>A few months ago a site I read regularly, <a href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a>, turned off their comment system supposedly because of overly offensive and hostile comments. Personally I think this is a bullshit. Ultimately it’s their site so their rules.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://vice.com">Vice.com</a> removed the comments from their blog they admitted to doing a poor job moderating the comments section. That reason hit home. Strike one, <strong>I’m lazy</strong>.</p>

<p>So let’s take laziness and add the concern of privacy. Part of the reason I originally wanted to run WordPress is because I care about privacy. Not just my privacy but the privacy of my readers. Yes. I care about you. I recently added <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> to my site as a light layer of protection. I switched to Jekyll for a variety of reasons but one of those reasons was having full control of how my site was built.</p>

<h2 id="i-guess-ill-get-to-the-point">I guess I’ll get to the point.</h2>

<p>In attempt to keep discussions where they belong and to maximize the options of privacy the comments will be missing from this site.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about making a page on either <a href="https://voat.co">Voat</a> or <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a> in the future. Though most of my pages usually don’t get enough comments to justify that.</p>

<p>You can, however, get a hold of me on <a href="https://twitter.com/arthursucks">Twitter</a>.</p>
