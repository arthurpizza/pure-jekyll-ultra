<p>I walked into a Best Buy yesterday and finally put my hands on a Samsung Chromebook. Best Buy is doing Chrome OS no favors by blocking all Google websites on their customer WiFi. A Chromebook without access to Google is pretty useless. Fortunately I had my trusty Nexus 4 and I was able to connect to the internet. After watching reviews and videos online there were a few things I fully understood only when actually using the hardware.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The keyboard is awesome. It felt very similar to my Apple keyboard at home. There was very little flex and creek that a lot of reviewers often talk about. With the exception of a missing backlight and a Command/Winkey/Superkey it felt like a premium keyboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s very tiny.  It’s not the same level smallness as an Apple Air but it’s damn close.  It’s smaller than some Ultrabooks and feels so light you’d think something is missing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The screen not the greatest.  It’s definitely not a dealbreaker for me but if screen quality is a big issue for your tastes you might avoid.  It’s less about the clarity.  At 1280×768 it doesn’t need to be very crisp.  The issue is the color and contrast.  Everything seems a little foggy.  I think in lower light areas this might not seem so drastic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gets warm, but not warm like my phone does.  Under a full load my phone feels twice as hot as this thing does.  That’s saying something because my phone rarely get hot enough to notice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chrome OS feels a lot like Linux  (I know it’s running Linux under, but so is Android).  More than I expected.  The synaptic experience reminds me of running XFCE on my old netbook.  Which brings me to my last point:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The synaptic pad is fantastic.  Mulitouch worked perfectly.  I was worried it would be too small but it feel like the perfect size for that laptop.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I decided after playing with it for a solid 30 minutes that I really want this laptop.  Sadly even at $250 it’s too expensive.  I’m living on a tight fixed budget and I can’t justify the purchase.  Being poor really sucks, but that is for another post.</p>
