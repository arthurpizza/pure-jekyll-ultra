												<p><img class="alignright" width="300" src="/images/th/google-tracks.png" />There was a time not long ago that I weighed almost 300lbs.  I’m not ashamed.  In fact I’m proud of the weight loss.  I’m still a fatty (always will be, being a fatty is all in your head!) but I’ve made a lot of progress.  At the time of writing this I’m down to 218lbs.  I still have quite a way to go.</p>

<p>One of the tools that made the weight loss easier was great software to help me track my progress.  I was using <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/">Endomondo</a> for the longest time.  I actually bought the full version of the application when it went on sale for 25¢.  These days I’ve become quite annoyed with the service.  Besides constantly wanting me to spam my friends and upgrade to a monthly ‘service(?)’ the application keeps getting more and more bloated.  I’m officially breaking up with Endomondo.</p>

<p>Hello My Tracks!  The program limits itself to raw numbers.  It doesn’t calculate calories burned but will tell you the elevation, distance, time, and a whole slew of other data.  These numbers are for you to crunch.  I’ve stumbled upon a overly simplistic calculation of calories:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>0.0(mph) x weight x time = calories
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Using the data from the screen shot my last walk would calculate to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>0.027 x 218 x 81 = 476.766
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or 477 calories burned.  This system seems to be in the same ballpark to what Endomondo was giving me.  Because of all the variables calorie counting is not an exact science.  I can assume that part of the reason it was left out of My Tracks.  Perhaps you know of a better calculation?</p>

<p>The business model of Endomondo seems to be the biggest drawback.  My Tracks is an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mytracks/">open source application</a> that will probably keep growing in features.  With the addition of a flexable API it opens a lot of doors for integration with other applications.  For my personal needs My Tracks is a better all around fit.  If you’re looking for a solution that respects your user right give My Tracks a try.</p>
