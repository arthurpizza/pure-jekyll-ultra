<p>I’m sure that somewhere in the past I’ve made statements that were essentially the antithesis of what I’m going to be writing here.  If you do find those statements disregard them.  I was wrong. It’s good to be wrong.</p>

<p>There have been a lot of articles about how Apple has stolen features of their competitors software in the new OS X Yosemite and iOS 8.  Looking at some of the images that came from Apple’s developer conference it’s easy to make those claims.  In fact I will say that Apple stole a lot.  And it’s a good thing.</p>

<p>Lets rewind the clock back to a few weeks after the launch of iOS 7.  A friend came into my work holding the tiny plastic Apple branded iPhone 5C and I touched it.  The body of the hardware felt rugged and the software strangely familiar.  It looked and felt like an Android phone.  After a few moments of playing with the device it hit me.</p>

<h2 id="everyone-should-steal-features-from-everyone">Everyone should steal features from everyone.</h2>

<p>This was the first time I enjoyed using an iPhone because it took features that I felt we fantastic about the Android OS.  I didn’t like these features because they were Android features but because they felt like excellent features for a phone.</p>

<p>Swype made a very popular gesture typing keyboard.  Everyone copied it, even Google.  The keyboard ecosystem in Android is better for it.  Microsoft stole that design for it’s new keyboard.  It’s a better system.  Everyone should have it and now Apple will have it too.</p>

<p>Let’s all get together and start stealing features.  I’d love to have bridge for SMS on my laptop.  I hope Apple lets users side load applications.  I hope that someday Windows gets a live environment for installing and repair.</p>

<p>Let’s steal it, rip it, remix it, and share it.  It’s great for us consumers and it keep the big boys like Apple on their toes.</p>
